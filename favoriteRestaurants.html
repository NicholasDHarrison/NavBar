<!-- let me know a better way to space this down, I could do it through CSS, or it would bring the whole green div down! -->


                To preface my choices, all of my preferences are dictated through the balance of convenience and
                satisfaction.
                This list will be based off of what I have near me.

                    <div class="BlackDiv"></div>
                    <p class="Thick">
                        The list is affected heavily by my travel time to these locations, I don't want to drive home with cold food!
                   </p>
                </div>

               

                <h4 class="NormalText">I currently am obsessed with burgers so the top spot should not surprise you!</h4>

                        <li>Wayback Burger</li>

                            <p class="ReasonWhy">
                                I have not enjoyed burgers in a long time, and just beef in general. As of right now I just have that craving.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                        <li>Sheslea's Pizza & Pasta</li>
                        
                        <p class="ReasonWhy">
                            That Mediterranean Pizza is the best pizza I have ever had personally.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <li>King of Spicy</li>
                        
                        <p class="ReasonWhy">
                            One of my all time favorite foods is Indian food, especially some Vegetable Tikka Misala.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        <li>Osaka Japanese Cuisine</li>
                           
                        <p class="ReasonWhy">
                                I love Japanese food, it's main selling point is all of the steamed vegetables.
                            </p>
                            <br>

                        <li>Mint Hill Rock Store BBQ</li>
                        
                        <p class="ReasonWhy">
                            BBQ is just one of those things I will randomly get a craving for, and its is so distinct that it deserves a spot on this list.
